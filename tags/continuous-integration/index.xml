      <description>Getting started with Hugo is very interesting especially when you are new to static site generators. Just run hugo serve and your markdown files are converted into a website. But, when it comes deployment it&amp;rsquo;s really painful if you&amp;rsquo;re doing it manually and it&amp;rsquo;s more painful when you have to do the whole process all over again just to fix a stupid typo.
In my previous post - Setting Up Hugo on GitHub Pages, I talked about hosting Hugo sites on GitHub pages and one of the reason for doing so was Travis CI.</description>
